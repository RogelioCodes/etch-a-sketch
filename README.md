# etch-a-sketch
This program is an etch a sketch that was made in order for me to practice more DOM manipulation in conjunction with styling.  This program also helped me practice event listeners and recursive functions. This program generates a grid of cells that gives the illusion of an etch a sketch.  The user can hover over these cells to color them, and this in effect creates pixel art.
